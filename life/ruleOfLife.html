<p>
There are some rules which as follows :

    A cell with 0 or 1 neighbor dies because of underpopulation.
    When a cell with 4 or more neighbors dies because of overpopulation.
    If any empty space has exactly 3 cells then a new cell is born in that empty space.
    If none of the above rules apply then the space does not change a live cell remains alive, and an empty space is still empty.
